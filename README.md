# CSE-121
A list of coding projects I made in C for my previous CSE-121 class.  
For any Clark College students: using this code in your assignments is academic dishonesty. Write your own code!  
Also, I do not provide a license for this code (for your own sake, this repo contains errors and bad programming practices)
